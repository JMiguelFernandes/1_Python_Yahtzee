    "## Welcome to Yahtzee!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yahtzee is a dice game where players roll 5 dice up to 3 times and score based on the combinations they get (kind of like a dice poker). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the rules:\n",
    "- In each game, the players take turns rolling the dice and choosing how to score based on the result of the roll.\n",
    "- Each player plays 13 rounds in total.\n",
    "In each round, the player can choose to reroll any number of dice up to two times.\n",
    "- The result is then scored (rules for scoring are in the table).\n",
    "- In each round, the player MUST score on one of the categories, and they can only score in any category ONCE.\n",
    "- If the player scores 65 points or more in the upper section, they automatically receive a 35 point bonus.\n",
    "- In the case of getting a second yahtzee the player gets an extra 100 points; this roll must still be scored\\n in one of the other categories as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed description of the rules is available here: http://www.yahtzee.org.uk/rules.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "To play, run all cells. The last cell starts the game by calling the `yahtzee()` function. By default, the yahtzee function runs the game in 2-player mode; to run with more players, simply pass the desired number of players as the single argument for the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the game starts, you will be presented with a short explanation of the rules. For every round of play, the scoreboard will be displayed and the dice rolls will be simulated. The game consists of 13 rounds per player, alternating between the players. \n",
    "\n",
    "Select which dice (if any) you want to reroll by inputting the respective dice numbers (1-5). Only the digits 1-5, without spaces or duplicates, will be accepted. The order doesn't matter (both 134 and 413 will reroll dice d1, d3 and d4). After inputting the dice numbers, press enter. If you don't want to reroll any dice, simply press enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done, you will be asked how to score your roll. Simply input the number corresponding to your option. Only the digits presented will be accepted as input, without spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have fun! :D\n"

    "#### List of functions defined here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `rules`() --> prints the rules\n",
    "2. `print_yahtzee`() --> prints an ASCII art text saying Yahtzee\n",
    "2. `scoreboard(nplayers)` --> builds the dataframe where the scores will be displayed\n",
    "3. `update_table(player, frame)` --> updates a couple of values on the upper section of the scoreboard; used to keep track of the players progress on the upper section of the scoreboard (to keep an eye on that sweet 35pt bonus)\n",
    "4. `print_scoreframe(nplayers, frame)` --> prints a pretty version of the scoreboard (took advantage of the tabulate module for this)\n",
    "5. `roll_dice(player)` --> simulates the rolling of the 5 dice and asks the player what dice they want to reroll up to two times\n",
    "6. `evaluate_roll(roll, player, frame)` --> creates a dictionary with information about which options for scoring are available (does not check if they would score anything, but whether they have been scored before or not)\n",
    "7. `scoring_input(evaluate_dict, player)` --> based on the options available (given by the previous function), asks the player how they would like to score a roll\n",
    "8. `calculate_score(roll, choice)` --> calculates the score of a roll given the player's choice\n",
    "9. `score(choice, roll, player, frame) --> takes the score calculated by the previous version and adds it to the scoreboard in the right position\n",
    "10. `one_round(player, nplayers, frame)` --> chains  functions 4-5-6-7-8-9-3 to simulate an entire round of play for one player\n",
    "11. `final_score(players_list, frame)` --> once both players have played 13 rounds, calculates the final scores and announces the winner\n",
    "12. `yahtzee(nplayers)` --> packages all functions into one neat little function that runs the game from beginning to end. It starts by showing the rules (1) and building the scoreboard (2) and then iterates the one_round function (10) 13 times for each player in an alternating pattern. Then, final score is calculated (11) and the winner is announced"
